</title><link>http://www.electbobferguson.com/2018/12/10/weeks-critical-deadline/</link><description>

<p>This week, Washington State's fundraising freeze goes into effect. That means I can't raise money until the end of the legislative session, which will last until mid-April <em>and maybe longer.</em></p>
<p><strong>I'm on the ballot in 2020, and the special interests on the far-right who think they can rig the system and buy elected officials will be coming after me. So will Trump's big-money friends.</strong></p>

<p>I'm fired up because, this year, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Took on Donald Trump's illegal actions and defended Washington values – and won. </li>
<li>Prosecuted big polluters. </li>
<li>Unraveled a rigged system in corporate franchises, helping millions of low-wage workers across the country. </li>
<li>Fought for women's rights and won the largest civil rights penalty for Washington state in history on behalf of women farmworkers who experienced traumatic sexual harassment and retaliation from their employer. </li>
<li>Took on the gun lobby and won, as the voters passed a great package of gun safety reforms last month. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>We still have so much work to do. We still have a president who attacks our core values and disregards the law and Constitution. Powerful interests still want to break the rules and get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>I can't raise grassroots donations starting in a few days, but the special interests that want to see me gone can raise as much as they want. I need you to fuel our team!</strong></p>

</title><link>http://www.electbobferguson.com/2018/12/03/victory-female-farmworkers/</link><description>

<p><strong>No woman should be sexually harassed on the job, but it's even more despicable when the company routinely ignores their complaints.</strong></p>
<p>But Quincy-based agricultural company Horning Brothers did exactly that when they allowed foreman Hermilo Cruz to prey on women for years.</p>
<p>Cruz controlled who got onion-packing jobs, which were in demand because of the scarcity of winter farm jobs. He hired only women, and then he groped them, made rude comments and gestures, and demanded sex in return for keeping their jobs. Yet when female employees brought Cruz's behavior to management's attention, they were ignored, fired, or not rehired for future seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Working with Northwest Justice Project, my office took the women's complaints straight to Federal Court.</strong> Horning Brothers tried to dodge responsibility for Cruz's predatory behavior, but the court slapped that down.</p>
<p>Now Horning Brothers will pay $525,000 to the women, making this the largest civil rights resolution ever for Washington state.</p>
<p>In addition, the company must adopt a non-discrimination and anti-retaliation policy approved by my office. It also must implement employee complaint procedures – in English and Spanish – for reporting harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. Finally, they're required to provide yearly trainings for management on their legal obligations.</p>
<p>This case highlights the high levels of discrimination and retaliation for reporting harassment experienced by women in the agricultural industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual harassment should</strong> <strong><em>never</em></strong> <strong>be thought of as an occupational hazard for female farmworkers. It has a profound impact on their ability to work safely and productively.</strong></p>
<p>As of 2015, nearly 30,000 women worked in the agriculture business – almost one-third of Washington's farm workforce. Our victory in the Horning Brothers sexual harassment case will hopefully force a culture change throughout the industry by <strong>bringing justice to the women, protecting future employees, and empowering female farmworkers whose voices have all too often been ignored.</strong></p>

<p>My record of going after Trump's illegal and immoral policies has made me a target for special interest PACs. <strong>They'd love nothing more than to remove me from office, and they're already lining up to attack.</strong></p>
<p>More than one hundred million dollars was spent in Attorney General races this election cycle – <em>an unprecedented amount.</em></p>
<p>I don't take money from corporate PACs. My funding comes from grassroots supporters like you.</p>

<pre><code>

<p>The president recently declared his intention to deny the existence of our transgender friends, family members, and neighbors. By changing the legal definition of gender, Donald Trump plans to take away the rights of transgender individuals, legalizing discrimination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.signherenow.org/petition/transgender-americans/ferguson/e/#subsource=pet-2018-11-transgender-americans-solo-email"><strong>Sign the petition: Tell the Trump administration to stop the attacks against transgender Americans.</strong></a></p>
<p>I will continue to fight discrimination against transgender Washingtonians.</p>
<p>Washington was the first state to challenge President Trump's attempt to ban transgender individuals from serving our country in the military. In one of our 15 legal victories against the Trump Administration, we've thus far successfully blocked that discriminatory, irrational, and unlawful policy. Thanks to legal challenges, transgender service members can continue to defend our country and our values.</p>
<p>But these lawsuits aren't over, and the fight continues.</p>
<p>Join me in standing up for our transgender neighbors. <a href="https://www.signherenow.org/petition/transgender-americans/ferguson/e/#subsource=pet-2018-11-transgender-americans-solo-email"><strong>Please sign this petition to stand up to President Trump's discrimination.</strong></a></p>
<p>Together, we can send a powerful message that Americans won't stand for these attacks on our neighbors, friends, and family.</p>

</title><link>http://www.electbobferguson.com/2018/11/20/hidden-victims-opioid-crisis/</link><description>

<p><strong><em>Thousands</em></strong> <strong>of children in Washington have had their lives turned upside down by opioid abuse.</strong></p>
<p>As Attorney General, my office advocates for children who have been abandoned, abused, neglected, or have no guardian able to care for them.</p>
<p>It's some of the most important work that we do.</p>
<p>Here's a shocking statistic: Of the thousands of cases my office handles involving abuse and neglect of children, nearly <em>half</em> are impacted by opioid abuse.</p>
<p><strong>The opioid epidemic is devastating Washington families. That's why I'm taking on opioid manufacturers and why I'm working to limit opioid prescriptions for Washington's youth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'll continue updating you on the fight to remedy the opioid crisis. Future generations of Washingtonians are at stake.</strong></p>

<p>Despite increased threats, Congress is refusing to take critical steps to improve the cybersecurity of our elections.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Washington is leading the way with vote-by-mail. Postage-paid vote-by-mail is working here in Washington. Mail-in ballots are unhackable and allow people to vote at their convenience.</p>
<p>It's time to <em>take it nationwide.</em></p>

<p>People should not have to wait in long lines to vote.</p>
<p><strong>We should be looking for ways to make voting easier, not harder.</strong></p>
<p>We must protect the integrity of our democracy by ensuring our elections are secure.</p>

</title><link>http://www.electbobferguson.com/2018/10/28/sign-petition-stop-trumps-attack-clean-power-plan/</link><description>

<p>Once again, Donald Trump is putting corporate polluters before the health of our communities. This time, he's attacking the Clean Power Plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.signherenow.org/petition/clean-power-plan-replacement/ferguson/e/"><strong>We're fighting back. Sign the petition to tell Donald Trump's EPA to keep the Clean Power Plan!</strong></a></p>
<p>Earlier this month, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued their strongest warnings yet that we're running out of time to stop runaway climate change.</p>
<p>But instead of taking urgent action to save our environment, the Trump administration is siding with Big Oil and Big Coal and trying to take us <em>backwards.</em></p>
<p>Trump is attacking President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which would have reduced carbon emissions by nearly 20 percent by 2030. <strong>Instead, Trump has offered a plan that would actually make hazardous air pollution worse: according to his own Environmental Protection Agency's calculations, Trump's action will</strong> <strong><em>lead to 1,400 premature deaths.</em></strong></p>
<p>I've helped defend Obama's Clean Power Plan in court against attacks from Big Oil and Big Coal. And I won't hesitate to defend it from the Trump administration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.signherenow.org/petition/clean-power-plan-replacement/ferguson/e/"><strong>Stand with me! Sign the petition against Trump's rollback of the Clean Power Plan.</strong></a></p>
<p>I know something about holding the Trump administration accountable: I've had to take them to court more than thirty times. I'm 14-0 so far. Recently, I've been working with attorneys general from other states to take the strongest possible legal action against Trump's attack on the Clean Power Plan.</p>
<p>We need you with us in this fight. The EPA can't put Trump's changes into effect until after the public gets a chance to make its voice heard. We need as many people as possible speaking out before the public comment period closes on October 31.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.signherenow.org/petition/clean-power-plan-replacement/ferguson/e/"><strong>Sign the petition: tell Donald Trump and the EPA to put public health and the planet ahead of industry profits and keep the Clean Power Plan.</strong></a></p>

</title><link>http://www.electbobferguson.com/2018/10/20/sexual-assault-survivors-deserve-justice/</link><description>

<p><strong>The president mocks sexual assault survivors.</strong> We must be better than that. We must all work to make it easier for survivors of rape and sexual assault to come forward.</p>
<p>And yet, across the country, hundreds of thousands of sexual assault kits that could provide important DNA evidence are shelved, untested.</p>
<p>Recently, my office inventoried Washington state's unsubmitted sexual assault kits and found more than <em>6,000 untested kits</em> in the evidence rooms of local law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>That's more than 6,000 stories with unanswered questions in Washington State alone.</p>
<p>Testing backlogged kits will identify rapists, sexual abusers, and link homicide cases across the country.</p>
<p>That's why I'm committed to doing everything I can to eliminate Washington state's backlog of untested sexual assault kits.</p>
<p><strong>I am putting together a team to assist in processing the backlogged sexual assault kits.</strong> We are supporting law enforcement agencies as they use the newfound information to reopen cold cases. And we are providing victim-centered training to law enforcement, prosecutors, and victim advocates.</p>
<p>Sexual assault victims and their families deserve justice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electbobferguson.com/petition/rape-kits/e/#subsource=pet-2018-10-rapekittesting-email"><strong>Sign the petition telling Congress to make sure every sexual assault kit is tested.</strong></a></p>
<p>The brave survivors who come forward to report rape and assault deserve every effort toward justice we can make on their behalf.</p>

</title><link>http://www.electbobferguson.com/2018/10/13/victory-hanford/</link><description>

<p><strong>Great news: We just won another victory against the federal government - this time on behalf of Hanford workers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks to our lawsuit, Rick Perry and the U.S. Department of Energy have finally agreed to start protecting the health and safety of the men and women cleaning up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.</strong></p>
<p>Hanford's underground tanks contain more than 56 million gallons of toxic waste – much of it radioactive – making it one of the most hazardous cleanup sites on the continent. The Hanford workers have one of the toughest, most important jobs in our state.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have needed to file a lawsuit to ensure their protection, <em>but I did.</em></p>
<p>Vapors leaking from these tanks contain more than 1,000 different chemicals, many of which are highly toxic. For more than 20 years, hundreds of Hanford workers suffered serious health problems, including heart, lung, and kidney problems, nerve damage, and brain disorders.</p>
<p>Yet the federal government refused to protect workers. Working with Hanford Challenge and the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local union, my office filed suit to force our federal government to do the right thing and keep workers safe.</p>
<p>Now, at last, the federal government signed an enforceable agreement to install monitoring and alarm systems, supply personal protective equipment, and develop technology that will capture and destroy the vapors. Our suit has only been put on hold, so if we're not satisfied with how this is going, we can go back to court.</p>
<p>On top of that, Jeff Sessions agreed to cut a check for <em>nearly a million dollars</em> that will be used in part to reimburse Washington taxpayers for the cost of bringing the action.</p>
<p><strong>Our victory sends a message that worker safety can never be compromised.</strong> The federal government will no longer be allowed to ignore the plight of workers at Hanford.</p>
<p>And if they try, working Washingtonians can always count on my office to fight for them.</p>
